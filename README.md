Trip 2018
=========

Upcoming trip info.  

How to use
----------

To read, just open the `.kml` file in Google Earth.  It will probably put it in `Temporary Places` and wrap it with a `Trip 2018.kmz`.

To commit changes, extract the `Trip 2018.kmz` as if it were a ZIP file (on windows, just change the extension to `.zip` and extract normally). On Linux use the `unzip` utility.  
Extract the KML file inside and commit your changes.  

If this is too hard maybe I'll write a script to automate some of this.  Or maybe putting this is git was a dumb idea and we should just keep emailing each other documents.  Or use Google Drive.

(KML is a plaintext file, "**K**eyhole **M**arkup **L**anguage.  KM**Z** is a compressed binary with a KM**L** that has been **Z**ipped).
